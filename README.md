# Baby Name Generator

This project was made with React, TypeScript, Styled Components, Jest and React Testing Library.
It uses a JSON file as a mock API response on the Frontend, and it's purpose is to generate a random Male or Female Baby Name.

## Getting Started

1. Before we can launch the app, please make sure all the dependencies are install, by running this on the command line:

```
yarn
```

2. After the installation of all the dependencies is complete, please run this script to launch the app:

```
yarn start
```

## Testing

Please run `yarn test` on the command line to launch the test runner in watch mode.
It will cycle through all the integration and unit tests made on Jest and React Testing Library.

## Other Useful Commands

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
